What is it?
-----------

Anything useful that depends only on java. So far:

 - support for dynamic dispatch (see doc/dynamic-dispatch.txt)
 - some equality primitives that might be useful for unit testing
 - a few IO adapters

This functionality might well be found in various Jakarta Commons
projects, but this uses the latest versions of java, and in many
cases borrows paradigms from other programming languages.
