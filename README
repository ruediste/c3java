What is it?
-----------

Anything useful that depends only on java. So far:

 - support for dynamic dispatch (see doc/dynamic-dispatch.txt)
 - some equality primitives that might be useful for unit testing
 - a few IO adapters

I suppose all of this might easily end up in various jakarta commons
projects so from an open source point of view, this is really just a
staging post.
